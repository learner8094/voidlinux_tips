--install with gnome
After installation
xbps-install -u xbps
xbps-install -Su
xbps-install -S gnome
or: gnome-core
xbps-install -S gnome-apps
xbps-install -S dbus
enable the dbus service:
sudo ln -sv /etc/sv/dbus /var/service

--remove xfce
sudo xbps-remove -R xfce4 xfce4-goodies xfce4-panel
sudo xbps-remove -o

---recommanded voidlinux packages
vpm: void package manager
sudo vpm up = update system
sudo vpm i pacakge = install package
vpm s package = search
vpm remove package 
vpm ar = autoremove - remove orphaned packages. orphans = unused automatic dependencies.

---clean the system
sudo xbps-remove -o   / remove orphans: Installed packages that were originally pulled in automatically as dependencies of another package, but are no longer required by any currently installed package.
sudo vkpurge list   / remove old kernels
sudo vkpurge rm all
sudo xbps-remove -O    / Remove obsolete cached packages (old versions no longer in repos or needed):
sudo xbps-remove -OO   / + remove uninstalled pacakges
sudo xbps-remove -Oo    / orphans + cache

---enable nonfree repository
sudo vpm i void-repo-nonfree
pacakges needed in it: zenmap
broadcom wireless driver - android-studio - nvidia drivers - scanner drivers - master-pdf-editor
---disable nonfree repo
sudo vpm remove void-repo-nonfree

---enable flatpak
sudo xbps-install -S flatpak
Add the Flathub repository, the primary source for Flatpak applications:
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak install flathub org.signal.Signal

Restart your system to complete the setup process. After rebooting, you can install applications.
Install the desired application using the flatpak install command. For example, to install Discord:
flatpak install flathub com.discordapp.Discord

--export the package list:
xbps-query -l | awk '{ print $2 }' | xargs -n1 xbps-uhelper getpkgname
save to list:
package-list.txt

--remove old packages from cache
To ensure that only the latest downloaded packages are stored and old versions are not retained, you can use the 
xbps-remove -O
command, which removes old, no-longer installed, or outdated package files from the cache

--copy this folder:
/var/cache/xbps

---copy database
/var/db/xbps/https___repo-default_voidlinux_org_current_musl

---install the packages in the other computer
xbps-install -Sf $(cat package-list.txt)
After installation, run xbps-reconfigure -a
rsync

---build a modified iso
kotoko/voidlinux-iso-extra ?
void-mklive-master
b = One of base, enlightenment, xfce, mate, cinnamon, gnome, kde, lxde, lxqt, or xfce-wayland
sudo ./mkiso.sh -a x86_64-musl -b gnome  -r /var/cache/xbps
/var/db/xbps isn't a repository. /var/cache/xbps is the local cache, but it would need to be turned into a repository with xbps-rindex
 -r <repo>          Use this XBPS repository. May be specified multiple times
 -c <cachedir>      Use this XBPS cache directory (default: ./xbps-cachedir-<arch>)
 
sudo ./mkiso.sh -a x86_64-musl -b gnome -- -c /var/cache/xbps -p "fwupd firefox libreoffice libreoffice-i18n-ar wine winegui cups cups-pdf cups-filters foomatic-db foomatic-db-engine fastfetch encfs git tor telegram-desktop android-tools ryt-dlp gimp newsboat vpm f3 ffmpeg virt-manager virtiofsd audacity make ImageMagick moserial gparted"

 -r /var/db/xbps/https___repo-default_voidlinux_org_current_musl 
 
 xbps-rindex?
 Other options can be passed directly to mklive.sh by specifying them after the --.
 
 /var/db/xbps/https___repo-default_voidlinux_org_current_musl/x86_64-musl-repodata
sudo xbps-rindex -a /var/db/xbps/https___repo-default_voidlinux_org_current_musl/x86_64-musl-repodata

/void-mklive-master/xbps-cachedir-x86_64-musl

---killall alternative: pkill
sudo pkill tor

---sub repos
nonfree: contains software packages with non-free licenses
multilib: contains 32-bit libraries for 64-bit systems (glibc only)
multilib/nonfree: contains non-free multilib packages
debug: contains debugging symbols for packages

---set up virt manager
sudo ln -s /etc/sv/libvirtd /var/service
sudo ln -s /etc/sv/virtlockd /var/service
sudo ln -s /etc/sv/virtlogd /var/service

ln -s /etc/sv/dbus /var/service
ln -s /etc/sv/polkitd /var/service

sudo usermod -aG libvirt void

You may also need to add your user to /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf to resolve permission issues when accessing 
 File > Add Connection. Select QEMU/KVM as the hypervisor. You can choose either the User session (qemu:///session) or System (qemu:///system) connection. The System connection is generally recommended as it provides access to all available resources and better networking capabilities. The User session connection has limited networking features and requires the system variant to be set up first for bridged networking.

While these files are useful for developers and system administrators, they can be safely deleted if you no longer need them for debugging, as they are not required for system operation.
